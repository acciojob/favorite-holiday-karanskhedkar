	<h1>Andaman & Nicobar</h1>
	<br/>
	<p>The Andaman and Nicobar Islands, a Union Territory of India located in the Bay of Bengal, comprise around 572 islands, of which only a few are inhabited. With Port Blair as the capital, the islands are known for their tropical climate, rich biodiversity, and pristine beaches. Home to a mix of indigenous tribes like the Jarwas and Sentinalese and settlers from various Indian states, the islands reflect a unique blend of cultures. Key tourist destinations include Havelock Island (Swaraj Dweep), Radhanagar Beach, and the historic Cellular Jail. Strategically significant for India's defense, the region is also noted for its coral reefs, marine life, and lush rainforests, making it a popular yet ecologically sensitive travel destination.</p>
